Luckily, we decided to go ahead with the visit to the Teotihuacan ruins. Strangely we arrived early, before the place was even poroperly opened and headed. The Teotihuacan civilization was building this amazing city and ceremonial site around 1,500 years ago. At the time, it was the largest urban centre in the world and also the most densely populated.

	<p class="style3">Mexico City has one of the largest populations and 
population densities in the world with over 20 millions VW 
Beetle-driving people living in one bowl-shaped valley, completely surrounded by 
mountains. As a result of the numbers and the enclosed geography, it also 
has one of the worst air-pollution problems on the planet. As a way of 
reducing the car pollution, the authorities forbid entry to the city to 
cars with registration plates ending in certain numbers on certain 
weekdays. This is called Hoy No Circula (Don�t Drive Today).</p>
<p class="style3">Mathematics problem for those of you with a knowledge 
of probability:</p>
	<p class="style3">Now, pay attention, as this will be on the exam. If 
Mexico City forbids cars with registration numbers ending in 3 and 4 to 
enter on Wednesdays, what is the probability that three Irish kayakers 
attempting to go around the city without entering it will fail to do so 
and end up within the Hoy No Circula zone? </p>

<p class="style3">
What is the probability that 
this will be on a Wednesday when 3 and 4 are the forbidden numbers? </p>

<p class="style3">
What is the probability that their car is a 4? </p>


<p class="style3">
What is the probability that 
they will be pulled over by corrupt cops and have a bribe extorted for 
this?</p>

<p class="style3">
For bonus marks, try this extra question: </p>
<p class="style3">

What is the probability 
that having being forced to spent four hours in a shopping center until 
the end of Hoy No Circula, the same car would be pulled over for the 
infringement of carrying �cargo� by different corrupt cops and have 
another bribe extorted?</p>
	<p class="style3">We have no pictures of these events, in fact we are 
luck to have retained our cameras, which were demanded at one point. 
All in all we spent about five hours in Mexico Districto Federal and it 
cost us about Euro400. Easily the worst day of the trip.</p>

	<p class="style3">We had been warned that the big cities of Guadalajara and Mexico were terrible for corrupt cops pulling tourists over and extorting bribes. On the outskirts of Guadalajara we were pulled over by a corrupt cop and had a bribe extorted. Apparently the U.S. practice of only showing one registration plate isn�t allowed in Mexico and the scumbag cop did us a favour, apparently, by not giving us a ticket. The worst aspect of this encounter was the big, complicated handshake afterwards to seal the deal. Definitely the closest I�ve ever come to refusing to shake hands with anyone. A cop taking a bribe is a lowlife, and this one tries to pretend otherwise, but he knows it.</p>

	<p class="style3">We bypassed the town of Tequila. Probably a good move.</p>

<p class="style3">We spent the night in the (almost) lakeside town of Chapala. I say almost, because the lakes in that area of central Mexico are seriously depleted by the heavy water demands of Guadalajara and Mexico cities. The jetty is at a remove from the water�s edge. Worse again, the lake is overgrown with water hyacinths, flourishing in the overfertilised environment. The town itself is fairly cool, and there seemed to be some kind of fiesta wrapping up when we arrived.</p>
