<p class="style3">Cuidad del Este is Paraguay's second city and exists largely because of the building of the world's largest hydroelectric dam and plant back in the 1970s. These days it's a duty free town popular with Brasilians and Argentines who make the short trek across the Friendship Bridge for the bargains. It's a messy but friendy town, despite its unsavoury reputation; again not many tourists - mostly day trippers. Kind of like Limerick really.</p>

<p class="style3">This is the view from the park looking across the Rio Parana to the Brasilian city of Foz de Iguazu. About five km south along the river is the confluence with the Rio Iguazu. The confluence marks the meeting point of Paraguay, Brasil, and Argentina.</p>

<p class="style3"><span class="style31"><img
src="images/scotland/cuidadandfoz.jpg"> </span></p>

<p class="style3">The following day, we took the Guatamala-style bus to the Itaipu Dam, just north of the town.</p>

<p class="style3"><span class="style31"><img
src="images/scotland/itapubus.jpg"> </span></p>

<p class="style3">Until the Three Gorges Dam in China comes on line, this is the biggest puppy - one of the wonders of the modern world. The dam (on the right) is eight km long, the spillway (on the left) is only for overflow. A joint project by Brasil (seen on the far side) and Paraguay (foreground), it generates 25% of Brazil's electricity supply and 80% of that of Paraguay. In terms of power ratings and size, this thing is classified as really, really big.</p>

<p class="style3"><span class="style31"><img
src="images/scotland/itapudam.jpg"> </span></p>

<p class="style3">OK - here's the geography lesson again: In the foreground you have Paraguay, the city on the left is Foz de Iguazu in Brasil, and the city on the right is Puerto Iguazu, Argentina.</p>

<p class="style3"><span class="style31"><img
src="images/scotland/threefrontiers.jpg"> </span></p>

<p class="style3">Here's a blurry picture of the turbine room (sorry Simon, it was dark). There are 18 of them, with two more being built, one on each side. Amazingly, Brasil and Paraguay are on different voltages, but it all seems to work fine.</p>

<p class="style3"><span class="style31"><img
src="images/scotland/itapumachineroom.jpg"> </span></p>

<p class="style3">Catherine, electronic engineer, is pleased with the plant and dropped off her CV at the front office.</p>

<p class="style3"><span class="style31"><img

<p class="style3">Really big wall, holding back a really big amount of water...</p>

<p class="style3">Really big pylons, marching off across the Brasilian plains...</p>

<p class="style3"><span class="style31"><img
src="images/scotland/itapupylons.jpg"> </span></p>

<p class="style3">The next day, all overwhelmed with the immense achievement of Itaipu, the team walks across the Friendship Bridge into Brasil. Contrary to what everyone thought, spoken Portugese is nothing like spoken Spanish. This was the first cultural shock of the new country.</p>

<p class="style3">On the left, shoppers pour into duty free Cuidad del Este. The motorbikes are taxis that zip over and back all day. We were the only ones bothering with border formalities. A chaotic border crossing.</p>

<p class="style3"><span class="style31"><img
src="images/scotland/friendshipsbridge1.jpg"> </span></p>

<p class="style3">On our first night in Cuidad del Este we had strolled across the bridge observing the smugglers at work. We don't know what was in the packages, but a van was carrying them quarter way out from the Paraguayan side, where they were transfered to motorbikes. The motorbikes took them to within 200 metres of the Brasilian border control, where they were thrown over the side of the bridge to some people waiting below. We didn't stop to ask any questions.</p>

see if you have the time and are hardcore enough is the Chaco region west of 
Asuncion.</p>

<p class="style3">From Resistencia it was a short hop into Paraguay, one of the real unknown countries on the itinerary. The border crossing was a little tense as the team had conflicting information on whether Irish citizens needed a visa or not. If they did, we would have to backtrack 300 km. As it turns out, that rule has been changed and everything went smoothly, without special visas.</p>

<p class="style3">Asuncion, the capital, was nothing like the book and other gringos 
had lead us to believe. It was cool, very laid back, not at all as 
impoverished as expected. We got the impression that not too many 
tourists make their way there - once again Scotland '04+1 was a 
tourist attraction.</p>

<p class="style3">This is the Presidencial Palace...</p>

<p class="style3"><span class="style31"><img
src="images/scotland/presidentialpalaceasuncion.jpg"> </span></p>

<p class="style3">Don't get me wrong about the poverty - Paraguay is the same as 
everywhere else in that there is a wide gap between rich and poor. 
This is the shantytown, unusually though, it is located  10 metres 
from the main plaza.</p>

<p class="style3"><span class="style31"><img
src="images/scotland/shantytownasuncion.jpg"> </span></p>

<p class="style3">A strange ethnic mix here - natives are Guaranis and their language 
is spoken by everyone. Oddly, there is a huge German community, and 
if you had no Spanish but only German, you would be fine. Lots of 
Mercedes Benz and alpelstrudel.</p>

<p class="style3">This is the Rio Paraguay, lined with rowing clubs and golf courses.</p>

<p class="style3"><span class="style31"><img

<p class="style3">On a side trip from a temporary base in 

Tucuman, the team went for a hike around the mountain town of 

Tafi de Valle. Funny how you never remember pain, and even 

after Macchu Picchu, a hike seemed like a good idea. In 

fairness, though, it was good to stretch the legs again after 

what had been a series of bus and jeep trips.</p>

<p class="style3">Near Tafi there is a collection of standing

believed that each family had a pillar outside the home, as a 

fertility symbol.</p>

<p class="style3"><span class="style31"><img

<p class="style3">Some of them are phallic, some are depictions

<p class="style3"><span class="style31"><img

them.</p>

<p class="style3">With the situation in Bolivia threatening to deteriorate further, the
team heads back into Argentina for a bit of a think about the onward
direction. Anyone looking a a map of South America might wonder where
exactly are they trying to go. There was a briefly-lived possibility
of getting cheap flights to Easter Island from Santiago, Chile, but
ultimately, nothing came of this. The decision was made to begin the
trek home.</p>

<p class="style3">With six weeks remaining before Catherine's flight to
Dublin out of Buenos Aires, a vague plan came together: Argentina,
Paraguay, Brazil, Uruguay, and back to Buenos Aires.</p>

<p class="style3">Upon reaching Uyuni the news was that Bolivia had a 
new president and so all the troubles were over. The team scrapped 
its plan of hightailing it back to Argentina in favour of exploring a 
little more of the country. As it turned out, the street protesters 
were only taking a break and that the new president would only have a 
week of peaceful rule before tensions flared up, the way tensions do, 
once more. Onwards to Potosi, for a brief time...</p>

thanks to this mountain, Cerro Rico (Rich Mountain).</p>

<p class="style3"><span class="style31"><img
src="images/scotland/potosicerro.jpg"> </span></p>

<p class="style3">The mountain was one of the richest deposits of 
silver in the world and the Spanish conquistadores wasted no time in 
exploiting it to the full. It didn't do the local Inca any good of 
course as all the silver was sent directly to Madrid. This mountain 
financed the Spanish Empire and all that went with it; Bolivia 
continues to be one of the poorest nations on the planet.</p>

<p class="style3">The Bolivians never lost their sense of humour, 
despite it all. This is the entrance to the Casa de Moneda, the mint 
in which the silver from the mountain was turned into Spanish coin. 
The mask over the arch is a representation of the Roman god Bacchus, 
the god of wine and good times. The liberated Bolivians put his 
laughing countenance up there when the Spanish were being kicked out 
of their colony.</p>

<p class="style3"><span class="style31"><img

<p class="style3">This is the room, kept in darkness, where the 
minting was carried out. The grinding and milling machines are made 
of durable cedar wood, sent from Sapin by ship to Buenos Aires and 
then 14 months by mule train to Potosi. It is estimated that this 
room generated over half of the wealth of the Spanish Empire.</p>

<p class="style3"><span class="style31"><img
