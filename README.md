# mm-archive

An archive of my static content ported over from the old hosting service that I used for mananamana.com.

This is the archive of the old pages, ephemera, and unfinished or abandoned projects from manamanmanana.com that I originally handcrafted in html back in the day when css was the cool new kid on the block. Did I ever tell you about the time I invented blogging in  an internet cafe in Bolivia? No?
