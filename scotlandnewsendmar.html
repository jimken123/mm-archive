      <P class=style3>The (mighty) Rio Futaleufu is the furthest south that our 
      trip will hit the water. March in Chile is, frankly, chilly. We roll into 
      town at the end of the kayaking season on Saint Patrick's Week. 
      Appropriately, the water is higher than it's been all season, according to 
      the rafting company we spoke with, as they got off the river early. We had 
      a wild time, running the classic 'Bridge-to-Bridge' section several times 
      and down to El Makal on the highest of the high water day. Luck o' the 
      Irish we managed to escape unbattered, with our eyes out on stalks.</P>
      <P class=style3>The river is a big volume classic with huge crashing 
      waves, big raft-eating holes, and a scary pourover rapid known simply as 
      'Pillow.' Here's Xavier styling the line and wondering how he got mixed up 
      with these Irish guys.</P>

      them. The team witchdoctor recommends a course of paragliding in the 
      Atacama Desert, further north where it's nice and toasty.</P>

      <P class=style3>Sometime late on the night of March 12 in Bariloche,

      <P class=style3>Guatemalan Jesus at his usual post pointing the way

      <P class=style3>Taking a break from Chilean waterfall jumping, we jump a 
      big waterfall in Argentina. Even here the bureaucrats try to stall our 
      ball by demanding a permit to run the river and closing the road for an 
      hour or so. We compromise by running La Cascada de Los Alerces at the 
      put-in for the usual run.</P>
      <P class=style3>This wasn't the biggest drop of the trip, but easily the 
      longest time any of us have inspected a drop and still run it. After a 
      bout of rock-paper-scissors, Jim was first to go. It's fairly lonely in 
      the eddy above this drop. Nice, quiet, and you don't really want to ferry 
      out of there.</P>

      <P class=style3>The put-in is on a side creek right at the Chilean customs

      <P class=style3>This time there was no thermal heating of the river and 
      the drops were bigger and more committing. We had some great lines and 
      some frankly poor lines. One relatively innocuous-looking drop claimed two 
      victims - first Alaskan Xavier plugged the centre line and got worked 
      before swimming and going deep, very deep. Then Simon sent his boat and 
      paddle down the centre line and butt-boofed the river-left line. Further 
      into the river the feeling that we had used up all our luck for the day 
      was compounded by Jim squishing a spider in his boat. The team retreated 
      from the sketchy drop with the nasty river-left and river-right matching 
      undercuts, and didn't even look at Salto de Indio.</P>

      <P class=style3>Later that evening the damn Chilean bureaucrats stymied us 
      once again. This time we couldn't leave Chile without some other document 
      relating to the recently-purchased car. The German influence is strong in 
      Chile - there are rules and that's the way it is. They simply go by the 
      rulebook without sorrow or joy or even offering possible solutions. You

      the way we stop at the Rio Fuy, a thermally-heated waterfall special. The 
      waterfall section is like a beginner's guide to waterfall jumping - all 
      the drops are clean, the highest is about four metres, the water is warm, 
      and the whole run a couple of hundred metres in length. We ran it the

      general alround old-man way of going on. Due to a technical mix-up, Ferg's

      <P class=style3>The Rio Palguin is the waterfall classic river in Chile. 
      It's broken down into three sections, imaginatively called Upper, Middle, 
      and, surprise surprise, Lower. Each section is only about two km long, but 
      it took us about four hours to run the Upper and Middle, because there was 
      a lot to scout, video, and photo.</P>
      <P class=style3>It was one of those drives to the put-in when no-one talks 
      very much, having read too many horror stories about huge drops, undercut 
      caves, and committing gorges. Thankfully, it was also one of those days on 
      which you get your groove on early enough and then it's happy days.</P>
