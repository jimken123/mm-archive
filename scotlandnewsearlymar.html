This astounding piece of bureaucratic incompetence had something to do with the customs guys who conducted the optional drug searches. They look at your pile of bags and ask you to nominate which one you would like searched for drugs. Of course, if you have any drugs, you can just leave them on the bus, which isn't searched.</p>

us had a lovely romantic time at the concert in the plaza. So, apart

	<p class="style3">Having postponed the dreaded four-day bus journey 
as long as possible, we finally bite the bullet and get started on 
the 4,500 km trek to Santiago, Chile. We had decided to hightail 
it directly to Chile in order to catch the water there before the end 
of the boating season. Afterwards the plan is to come back north 
through Peru and Bolivia. It really wouldn't do to pass through those 
places and only see them through the windows of a bus, or in our case 
several buses.</p>

	<p class="style3">The bus odyssey begins with a relatively painless 
two-hour warm-up excursion to Rio Bampa and ends with a bum-numbing 
30-hour epic through northern Chile. In between there were four other 
buses, as well as assorted taxis, border crossings, bad bus food, and 
several heated discussions with bus company lackeys reluctant to find 
space for kayaks. Eighty two hours on buses - not recommended. Ever wondered why bus depots are full of mad people talking to phone boxes or babbling about God? It's because they have travelled too long down the back of a bus, wedged between screaming babies and the blocked toilet.</p>
<p class="style3">Here's what they don't like about us: Four 
kayakers, four kayaks, four rucksacks, four day packs, three 
paragliders, bag of paddles.</p>

	<p class="style3">Sigh. Here is the result of the Big Mountain 
Challenge: Cotopaxi 5:
Scotland '04+1 0. The team was utterly defeated by a huge mountain.</p>
	<p class="style3">Cotopaxi is a 5,800 m volcano just south of the 
equator. It's complete with glacier, year-round snow, and a distinct lack of oxygen. One of 
the traditional day-off activities of all Scotland trips is the obligatory hike up the 
largest mountain we can find. We did Cotopaxi all the right way - three-day, fully-guided trip with 
all gear, guides, and acclimatisation. Amazing trip - completely opened our eyes about that 
stuff.</p>
<p class="style3"><span
class="style31"><img src="images/scotland/guidehikingcotopaxi.jpg" width="512" height="384"> </span></p>
<p class="style3">The refuge where we spent the night before the 
ascent is at the height of Mont Blanc's summit. We arrived at the National Park at
noon Tuesday (3,800 m) and went for a short hike on the level bed of
a dry lake. In the thin air, you become breathless if you try to jog 
or climb a slight hill. All in bed by 7 PM.</p>
<p class="style3"><span
class="style31"><img src="images/scotland/cotopaxirefugio.jpg" width="384" height="512"> </span></p>
	<p class="style3">The next morning we drove an hour up to 4,300 m. 
It then took an hour to cover about 2 km horizontal and 250 m in vertical distance. A very 
sudden and exhausting wake-up call. We ate and slept, and then went to the glacier to practice with crampons and ice axes. By 6 PM Mr. Fred was in pieces with altitude
sickness (headache and throwing up) and had to go back down with one
of our guides. We then slept until midnight, the planned beginning
time for the estimated six hours climb to the top. Ferg was sick as a
dog, worse than Mr. Fred. He had to go down. They are very strict
about guide-punter ratios around here, so one of the remaining
(relatively) healthy people had to go down also. After a round of
rock-paper-scissors between Jim, Simon, and Cliona, it was decided 
that Jim had to go down too. In our exhausted state, it is still undecided if Jim won or lost in 
this instance.</p>
<p class="style3">At about 1 AM, Simon and Cliona, along with the two 
remaining guides, set out for the summit,
it has to be said not with 100% confidence. They made it to a
creditable 5,300 m by 3:30 AM, before complete exhaustion, blinding
headaches, lack of sleep, and oxygen deprivation forced them back too.</p>
	<p class="style3"><span
class="style31"><img src="images/scotland/cotopaxievening.jpg" width="512" height="384"> </span></p>
<p class="style3">We are all a little humbled by the experience and have developed a
(grudging) respect for climber types. A fantastic experience, but
only in hindsight. At the time, we just wanted to get it done, up or
down.</p>
