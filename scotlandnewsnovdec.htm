	<p class="style3">Barely 10 km inside Honduras we visited one of the (non-kayaking) 

highlights of the trip - the ancient Mayan city of Copan. At the height of this 

civilisation, many of the cities we have seen coexisted, but Copan is now regarded as one of 

the most beautiful. This is the hieroglyphic staircase, on which the hieroglyphs tell the 

history of the city and its 17 rulers.</p>

caffeine drip can be seen here at an enforced layover between the Guatemalan and Honduran

half-caf, low-cream, semi-skimmed frappacino macchiata with cinnamon sprinkles, his

Readers paying attention will know that the trip motto is 'Indecision

the flexibility and decide on courses of action. Who gets the single

first?</p>

<p class="style3">Decisions of this importance are decided by a variant of the
paper-rock-sissors game. The odd one out gets the single bed, the
extra-egg omlette, runs the scary waterfall first.

coming your way, all enquiries should be made to Catherine, to whom a
big box of the stuff is winging its way. If she denies receiving
anything in the post, but has put on lots of weight, you know what
happened to your chocolate. Things of note in Oaxaca include the use
of green stone in the public buildings, millions of craft shops, and
two-for-the-price-of-one Pina Coladas. We ordered four of the latter,
expecting to have to pay for two - we received eight and paid for
four. Happy days. Here's the etno-botanical garden: </p>
