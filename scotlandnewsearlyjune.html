<p class="style3">After a difficult morning with hours of delay at the hotel on the edge of 

the salt plains, it eventually transpires that Hector, our driver, had been involved in a car 

crash in the night on his way back from a fiesta at a nearby village. The 4x4 was trashed, 

but we were told that he and his companion were injured but fine. The rest of the Salar trip 

was undertaken with a substitute driver and everyone was a little on edge.</p>

<p class="style3">Finally on the real salt plains, Jim takes a personal moment in front of 

the Isla de Pescas (the inappropriately named Island of the Fishes).</p>

<p class="style3"><span class="style31"><img

<p class="style3">Salar de Uyuni stretches across vast areas of Bolivia and down into Chile. 

It's composed of salt deposited from a long-gone ocean. The salt is four metres deep 

according to our new driver, and 100 metres deep according to the driver of the other jeep. 

Either way, it's made of lots of salt.</p>

<p class="style3">This bus is small...</p>

<p class="style3"><span class="style31"><img

<p class="style3">This is the salt mining operation at the other edge of the plain. The salt 

harvesting industry is essentially a two-part process that works like this: Step 1 - dig 

salt. Step 2 - put salt in bags.</p>

blinding, and sometimes traumatic enterprise all undertaken just for you. For you, gentle 

reader, we have suffered all manner of indignities. For Cyril and Jim these privations 

included, but were not limited to, several bad hair days...</p>

<p class="style3">On the second day of the jaunt across the Salar de Uyuni after one of the coldest nights in recent times, the merry band gets a bit of bouldering practice. The rocks here, in the midst of a giant desert, have been sandblasted by the wind for thousands of years, giving rise to yet another surreal landscape. What are you going to do except climb up there?</p>

<p class="style3"><span class="style31"><img
src="images/scotland/salarpiedra.jpg"> </span></p>

<p class="style3">This is the most famous of those rocks - Arbol de Piedra, the stone tree. Jim nearly had it too, just needed five more minutes to figure out the crux move. Honest.</p>

<p class="style3"><span class="style31"><img

<p class="style3">Although the sun is blinding, it's fiercely cold on the plains, even in the middle of the day. This is the (leaking) watertower for the railway that used to serve the town of Julaca, when it was an important nitrate mining centre.</p>

<p class="style3">Nowadays it serves as a major venue for children scrounging sweets from passing gringos. This was also the beginning of a series of bad hair days for Jim.</p>

<p class="style3">The Salt Plains of Bolivia were one of the few things in Bolivia that it was possible to get to, given the demonstrations and protests paralysing that country. The only border into Bolivia open was the Salar de Uyuni crossing from San Pedro de Atacama in Chile.</p>

<p class="style3">There are no roads across the Salt Plains for much of its extent, so you have to sign up for a multi-day tour in a 4x4. The team travelled with a group consisting of two Belgians, a Brazilian, a French Canadian, and the driver, Hector, who was later to be involved in a nasty car crash. He's OK, or so they told us.</p>

<p class="style3"><span class="style31"><img
src="images/scotland/lagunaverdejeep.jpg"> </span></p>

<p class="style3">On the first day, after crossing into the bitter cold of Bolivia, there's Laguna Verde. It's the action of the wind whipping up the copper and other chemicals (originating from the volcano in the background) in the water that cause the green colour. Before 11 AM, when there's no wind, the lake is just lake-coloured. It looks like the Mediterranean, but it was freezing cold here.</p>

<p class="style3"><span class="style31"><img
src="images/scotland/lagunaverdeview.jpg"> </span></p>

<p class="style3">On a day that seemed to take us from one bizarre natural feature to another, next up were the Dali-esque rock structures. This place looks like the background of Dali's 'Melted Clocks' picture, and indeed, Salvador himself visited here, so perhaps this was the inspiration for that work.</p>

<p class="style3"><span class="style31"><img

<p class="style3">This was one of those 'back on the bus, y'all' whistle-stop expeditions, but there was time to warm up in the thermal springs, only metres from a frozen lake. Go Catherine...</p>

<p class="style3"><span class="style31"><img
src="images/scotland/salarthermal.jpg"> </span></p>

<p class="style3">The last stop of the day was at the boiling mud baths of doom. Warmer than the thermal springs, but not advised, despite the beneficial aspects for your skin.</p>

in a bed, that kind of thing. Catherine felt the need for Cuba Libres 
(rum and coke) and, subsequently, the need to dance on bar tops.</p>

<p class="style3">Deciding that enough was enough, Officer Mahony takes the road home, 
splitting out from the rest of the team at Arica, Chile. This 
border town has featured heavily on the Scotland ÔøΩ04+1 route, with 
various members of the team crossing over and back from Peru to Chile 
at least four times here. This photo is taken at the same spot in the
