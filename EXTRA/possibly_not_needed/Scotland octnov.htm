      <P class=style3>******************************************************** 
      *************************************</P>
      <P class=style3>We have been out on the water again, this time in the 
      Barranchas del Cobre (in English known as the Copper Canyons), in the 
      Mexican state of Chihuahua. The Copper Canyons are a series of twenty 
      gorges in a national park. They are the deepest in the North Americas, as 
      my poor feet can testify. We spent a day getting to the canyon rim on the 
      CHEPE Ferrocarril train (clase economica, of course), and the train 
      journey is a trip`worth doing in its own right. </P>
      <P class=style3><SPAN class=style31><IMG height=512 
      src="Scotland octnov_files/dscf0416.jpg" width=384> </SPAN></P>
      <P class=style3>The track rises from the Pacific coast to a height of 2237 
      m where we got off at the really cold station of El Divisidero (which is 
      Spanish for The Divisadero). The only hotel there charges US$144 so we 
      slept three to a two-man tent in the train station. Perhaps the coldest 
      train station I�ve ever slept in, but certainly not the 
best-appointed.</P>
      <P class=style3><SPAN class=style31><IMG height=384 
      src="Scotland octnov_files/dscf0435.jpg" width=512> </SPAN></P>
      <P class=style3>The next morning (early) we managed to secure the services 
      of Jilo and his burros to guide us and carry our boats down into the 
      canyon. Bargaining began at US$200 and 80 km, but we got it down to 50 and 
      8, respectively.</P>
      <P class=style3><SPAN class=style31><IMG height=384 
      src="Scotland octnov_files/dscf0018.jpg" width=512> </SPAN></P>
      <P class=style3>The hike down into the depths to the river level of about 
      600 m, with the changing scenery, landscape, and eventually, climate (cold 
      at the top, banana trees at the bottom). I can�t do justice to the scale 
      or impact of the canyons. It�s so vast, one couldn�t hope to get down 
      through the endless side canyons without help. The photos can�t capture it 
      either, so you�ll have to go yourself.</P>
      <P class=style3><SPAN class=style31><IMG height=384 
      src="Scotland octnov_files/dscf0020.jpg" width=512> </SPAN></P>
      <P class=style3>After six hours hiking in, we were thankful to find the 
      river in low water, as we were hoping it would be. A high level in such a 
      remote, committing gorge would have meant a hike out, and the burros 
      didn�t seem up to it. We arrived at the riverside at dusk and camped out 
      under the stars. On the water at 7:45 AM (!) as we were unsure of how long 
      it would take to run the 46 km stretch of the Rio Urique we wanted to 
      do.</P>
      <P class=style3><SPAN class=style31><IMG height=512 
      src="Scotland octnov_files/dscf0051.jpg" width=384> </SPAN></P>
      <P class=style3>No major kayaking incidents to report - two portages, one 
      of which we might have run in a less remote area. With all the camping 
      gear and food in the back of the boats, it was a long day, again finishing 
      at dusk in the village of Urique. As if from a dream, the first hotel we 
      dripped into (having no other clothes into which to change) had a room 
      with a bed each, hot showers, a restuarant across the road, and the 
      following day�s bus stopping directly outside. The next day was spent 
      getting back to base and onwards to pick up our original southerly 
      direction. A five day detour encompassing a precipitous train ride up, a 
      burro-lead descent, a long day on the water, a bus and train journey back 
      out.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>

      <P></P>
      <P class=style3>After crossing the US/Mexico border no less than three 
      times in one morning, we hot-footed out of Tijuana, taking the advice of 
      everyone we met to skip it. On Mexico Highway 1, we travelled south for 
      1,500 km of the peninsula of Baja to La Paz, arriving just in time for a 
      bowl of the finest pork soup en el mundo. On the way the road passes 
      through an amazing shifting vista of cactus deserts, unexpected 1,000 
      meter peaks of twisting mountains, along the dunes of the Pacific surf 
      beaches, a wine-growing region, the sheltered Gulf de Mexico (Sea of 
      Cortez) side. We camped mostly on the beaches, finding them by chance or 
      on recommendation of various gringos nort americanos migrating south to 
      the surfing beaches for the winter.</P>
      <P class=style3>We visited various spots on the way, notably the mission 
      town of San Ignacio, which was the first town to fit the notion I, at any 
      rate, had of a Mexican village � a plaza where everything happens 
      (volleyball the night we were there) with the Spanish church predominating 
      one end, the official buildings at the other end. It is situated in a 
      small valley about two km off the Highway 1, and more importantly in a 
      river valley slightly below the elevation of the surrounding desert. So it 
      has a semitropical microclimate, complete with palm trees, and the above 
      mentioned cool shady square.</P>
      <P class=style3><SPANCLASS="STYLE31"><IMG height=384 
      src="Scotland octnov_files/sanignacio.jpg" width=512> </SPAN></P>
      <P class=style3>We stayed out the road, with a self-appointed guard dog 
      who kept the nocturnal horses and pigs at bay, all for a measly reward of 
      some biscuits. I suspect this will not be our last encounter with a lame 
      dog in Mexico.</P>

      <P class=style3>We also saw the town of Santa Rosalia with its steel 
      church prefabricated in Paris by none other than Alec Eiffel, who as we 
      know, built the Eiffel Tower � they didn�t like it, but he built it 
      anyway, they didn�t know it was panoramic.</P>

      <P class=style3>We are in La Paz, the last major town in the south of 
      Baja, awaiting the midnight ferry to the mainland. The next possible 
      destination for Scotland �04 is Barranca del Cobre (Copper Canyon) if we 
      can find a suitable kayaking section. If not, we will probably go anyway 
      and hike some of it. Here are the boys waiting for Isolde�s Tower to 
      open.</P>

      <P class=style3>It's often best the get the disastrous stuff out of the 
      way upfront, so in an unusual turn of events, that's what we did. No major 
      expedition of six months in length is worthy of the name unless there is 
      the involvement of the local police and, if possible, a dramatic nighttime 
      helicopter extraction.</P>
      <P class=style3>First paddling of the trip at the weekend - South Folk of 
      the American River - nice easy class 3 - 20 miles of it in low flow. 
      Turned out to be a real epic - Simon opted to drive the car shuttle while 
      blind probe duties were carried out by Jim, Ferg, and Paul McGrath. Y'all 
      know Paul? He's a friend from the canoe club who now lives in San 
      Francisco. This is Paul at the top, practicing his low braces and so 
      forth. Always practices your low braces and so forth if you are going 
      paddling for the first time is a few years.</P>
      <P class=style3><SPAN class=style31><IMG height=410 
      src="Scotland octnov_files/paulbrace.jpg" width=308> </SPAN></P>
      <P class=style3>This being America, the river was longer than we had 
      imagined. Paul took a few swims, got a little tired, got his roll, got a 
      lttle more tired, missed his roll. As it got dark (surprise, surprise, we 
      ended up running the river in the dark), Paul started to miss his roll 
      more often, and I think, he was also missing his happy, sedentary 
      lifestyle, his apartment by the Golden Gate Park, and the lovely Robin. 
      Y'all remember Robin? She remembers you guys, some more fondly than 
      others. </P>
      <P class=style3>Meanwhile back on the river, it was decided to walk out at 
      6:48 PM. Ferg and Paul started to hike down the rough riverbank, Jim 
      paddled down to the takeout, where Simon was, frankly, a little concerned, 
      given that it was dark at the time. With the urging of two local hunters - 
      the nicest gun-toting, mountain lion hunting, church-going, Bush voters 
      you're ever likely to meet on a dark road in rural California, the police 
      were called in. Ferg and Paul, meanwhile, were slogging their way down the 
      (steep, rocky, dark, overgrown) riverbank, having covered about 2.5 miles 
      of the remaining 5 miles to the takeout.</P>
      <P class=style3><SPAN class=style31><IMG height=308 
      src="Scotland octnov_files/photo16.jpg" width=410> </SPAN></P>
      <P class=style3>Scott, the nicest gun-toting El Dorado County California 
      Highway Patrol officer you're ever likely to meet on a dark road in rural 
      California, duly arrived at the bridge. His radio chatter had been picked 
      up by the police helicoper, which happened to be in the area. The CHIPS 
      guys (y'all remember Francis Poncherello and Jon Baker?) in the helicopter 
      came thundering up the valley past the gathering crowd at the takeout, all 
      spotlights, noise, and $3.5 million worth of gear. They spotted the guys 
      immediately - their nightvision goggles picking out Ferg's headtorch no 
      problem.</P>
      <P class=style3><SPAN class=style31><IMG height=308 
      src="Scotland octnov_files/photo14.jpg" width=410> </SPAN></P>
      <P class=style3>The river gorge was quite narrow, so they landed one skid 
      on the rock and kept the rest of the chopper over the water, loaded up the 
      two boys (who had been hiking out for two hours) and had them at the 
      bottom minutes later (10:15 PM), tucking into pork chops and chocolate 
      bars provided by another local guy and his son.</P>
      <P class=style3><SPAN class=style31><IMG height=308 
      src="Scotland octnov_files/photo6.jpg" width=410> </SPAN></P>
      <P class=style3>So, what did we do wrong? Paul is a sufficiently competent 
      paddler for the river, but the length of it (20 miles) was too much for 
      his level of fitness. Also, we should have been more clear about the 
      details of the proposed walk-out route.</P>
      <P class=style3>What did we do right? We got off when it was time to get 
      off and we called 911 when the hunters talked about mountain lions (there 
      have been some attacks recently). The professionals were pleased with our 
      equipment and tactics - on the river we had a headtorch, first aid kit, 
      snap light, space blanket, matches, water, energy bars, and all that.</P>
      <P class=style3><SPAN class=style31><IMG height=308 
      src="Scotland octnov_files/Paul_McGrath.jpg" width=410> </SPAN></P>
      <P class=style3>Some members of the expedition are anxious to point out 
      that we didn't call in the helicopter - it was in the area anyway. The 
      walking party were not concerned, just prepared to hike it out - left to 
      their own devices, they had about about another two hours hike to the 
      bottom.</P>

      <P class=style3>We paddled back in the following day, and retrieved the 
      stashed boats without incident.</P>

      <P class=style3>At last we are getting towards a semblence of a kayaking 
      trip, having bought some boats in Sacramento. We looked at the Dagger 
      Juice and G:Ride, Necky Mission, LiquidLogic Trigger and Lil' Joe, before 
      deciding that Scotland '04 needed matching boats. So we all bought Pyranha 
      I:3s.</P>
      <P class=style3>For non-kayaking geeks who may have arrived on this page 
      by accident, the boat comes in three sizes, approximately small, medium, 
      and bubble butt. We bought one of each. I'm not going to tell you who got 
      which one, but answers on a postcard, please.</P>

      <P class=style3><SPAN class=style3>No kayaking news to report yet - we 
      have been here a few days and I tells ya, living in a house with two 
      two-years olds is extreme stuff. Here they are looking charming. Bear in 
      mind that the picture was taken with high-speed film, as regular film 
      would just show two tornado-like blurs moving in a kind of furious 
      Brownian motion.</SPAN> </P>

      is perhaps more worrying. Some folks were concerned about my ability to 
      look after the guys on the river, and I reassured them that everything 
      would be great, but now I fear that looking after Ferg and Simon off the 
      river might be beyond me. As you see, sometimes it is hard to tell which 
      ones are the adults around here. </SPAN></P>

      this week, that's our main priority. We have also acquired a small 
      mountain of kayaking and camping equipment and a disturbingly large amount 
      of items in the colour orange. Teeshirts, hats, sleeping bags, peli cases, 
      buoyancys, cags - all tangoed. UCDCC Loyal Orange Lodge will march to 
      Panama on the traditional route, just as our fathers and forefathers did 
      before us, etc., etc.</SPAN></P>

      move on to announcing details of the trip itself.</SPAN></P>
      <P class=style32><SPAN style="COLOR: #ff6000">Some people have expressed 
      an interest in coming out to catch up with the Scotland �04 expedition at 
      some point. We would love to see you out there if any of the following 
      places and dates fit in with your holiday plans.</SPAN></P>
      <P class=style32><SPAN style="COLOR: #ff6000">For lots of the time we will 
      be on the road moving along every day, so certain portions of the trip 
      probably would not be so great if you only have two or three weeks. So, 
      you should probably consider some of the places we intend to stop and base 
      ourselves for extended periods - Southern Mexico, Costa Rica, Ecuador, and 
      Chile. </SPAN></P>

      <P class=style32><SPAN style="COLOR: #ff6000">If you are looking to go 
      river-running, we would suggest Costa Rica, where we will be for most of 
      December. Costa Rica has every level of paddling, ranging from 
      ICU-qualified right up to old-school UCD. An alternative to Kerry for New 
      Year? If you are looking for us, we�ll be on the beach. </SPAN></P>
      <P class=style32><SPAN style="COLOR: #ff6000">Chile also looks good for 
      kayaking, as well as for playboating for you bow-stalling types with your 
      new-fangled ways of capsizing really fast. We�ll be down south in Chile, 
      in the Futaleafu region. I�ll be the one drinking the Chilean Red. 
      </SPAN></P>
      <P class=style32><SPAN style="COLOR: #ff6000">For those of you interested 
      in a little paragliding, all the countries look good, apparently. 
      </SPAN></P>
      <P class=style32><SPAN style="COLOR: #ff6000">Ecuador will be a mix of 
      everything, we expect, but it is really the place about which we know 
      least. </SPAN></P>
      <P class=style32><SPAN style="COLOR: #ff6000">For people interested in 
      hiking and climbing mountains, you might want to look into coming out for 
      the Peru section � we intend to drag Ferg�s lazy bones up the Inca Trail 
      to Macchu Picchu and possibly sacrifice him to some easily-pleased deity. 
      </SPAN></P>
      <P class=style32><SPAN style="COLOR: #ff6000">The expedition hits the 
      Minty Highway on October 6; first stop is my mate Fino�s gaff in San 
      Francisco, California.</SPAN></P>
