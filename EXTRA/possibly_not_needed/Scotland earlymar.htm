      <P class=style3>Van and boats sorted, we rejoined the Pan American Highway 
      and headed south. Keep the Andes on the left and the sea on the right, and 
      you can't go wrong. Chile is 5,000 km from north to south and about 15 m 
      wide east to west. For this reason all football pitches here are aligned 
      north to south. The PanAmerican Highway is closed on Saturday afternoons 
      for a period of 45 minutes, then open for 15 minutes, then closed again 
      for a further 45 minutes.Anyway, we went to the Siete Tazas (Seven 
      Teacups), which is a world-renowned classic of simple waterfalls. The name 
      comes from the teacup-shaped pools at the bottom of each drop.Here's a

      trek to Santiago, Chile. We had decided to hightail it directly to Chile 
      in order to catch the water there before the end of the boating season. 
      Afterwards the plan is to come back north through Peru and Bolivia. It 
      really wouldn't do to pass through those places and only see them through

      assorted taxis, border crossings, bad bus food, and several heated 
      discussions with bus company lackeys reluctant to find space for kayaks. 
      Eighty two hours on buses - not recommended. Ever wondered why bus depots

      <P class=style3>Sigh. Here is the result of the Big Mountain Challenge: 
      Cotopaxi 5: Scotland '04+1 0. The team was utterly defeated by a huge 
      mountain.</P>
      <P class=style3>Cotopaxi is a 5,800 m volcano just south of the equator. 
      It's complete with glacier, year-round snow, and a distinct lack of 
      oxygen. One of the traditional day-off activities of all Scotland trips is 
      the obligatory hike up the largest mountain we can find. We did Cotopaxi 
      all the right way - three-day, fully-guided trip with all gear, guides, 
      and acclimatisation. Amazing trip - completely opened our eyes about that 
      stuff.</P>

      <P class=style3>The refuge where we spent the night before the ascent is 
      at the height of Mont Blanc's summit. We arrived at the National Park at 
      noon Tuesday (3,800 m) and went for a short hike on the level bed of a dry 
      lake. In the thin air, you become breathless if you try to jog or climb a 
      slight hill. All in bed by 7 PM.</P>

      <P class=style3>The next morning we drove an hour up to 4,300 m. It then 
      took an hour to cover about 2 km horizontal and 250 m in vertical 
      distance. A very sudden and exhausting wake-up call. We ate and slept, and 
      then went to the glacier to practice with crampons and ice axes. By 6 PM 
      Mr. Fred was in pieces with altitude sickness (headache and throwing up) 
      and had to go back down with one of our guides. We then slept until 
      midnight, the planned beginning time for the estimated six hours climb to 
      the top. Ferg was sick as a dog, worse than Mr. Fred. He had to go down. 
      They are very strict about guide-punter ratios around here, so one of the 
      remaining (relatively) healthy people had to go down also. After a round 
      of rock-paper-scissors between Jim, Simon, and Cliona, it was decided that 
      Jim had to go down too. In our exhausted state, it is still undecided if 
      Jim won or lost in this instance.</P>
      <P class=style3>At about 1 AM, Simon and Cliona, along with the two 
      remaining guides, set out for the summit, it has to be said not with 100% 
      confidence. They made it to a creditable 5,300 m by 3:30 AM, before 
      complete exhaustion, blinding headaches, lack of sleep, and oxygen 
      deprivation forced them back too.</P>

      <P class=style3>We are all a little humbled by the experience and have 
      developed a (grudging) respect for climber types. A fantastic experience, 
      but only in hindsight. At the time, we just wanted to get it done, up or 
      down.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>

      <P class=style3>After an exhausting series of rivers, the cry went up from 
      the masses: "Beach! Beach! Beach!"</P>
      <P class=style3>So we went to the beach, again. Soon we were joined by 
      Team Scotland (following us around like a bad smell), Jam (who continues 
      to be trapped in Ecuador without a passport), and Cliona (direct from 
      Machu Picchu).</P>

      <P class=style3>A full itinerary of beach activities ensued, ranging from 
      sitting on the sand to sitting out the back of the surf. In both 
      instances, the important thing was to work on our tans. Other days we 
      walked on the beach.</P>

      <P class=style3>We watched the sun set on the beach a number of days in 
      succession. As the glowing orb subsided over the tropical waters, we 
      pondered: 'When did we lose our enthusiasm for participating in exercise 
      and motion-based activities?�</P>

      <P class=style3>The pan pipes have to be the greatest crime against music 
      ever inflicted on the average man. Having survived Marimba and Mariachi 
      music so far, Heavens resolve our mettle to survive this added trauma, 
      which will surely only worsen as we continue higher into the 
mountains.</P>
      <P class=style3>Surely there is no good reason for the 'haunting' strains 
      of Beatles standards such as the elevatoresque Let It Be, irritating 
      enough in the original, funnelled through the reedy homogenising effect of 
      those pathetic little bamboo sticks.</P>
      <P class=style3>A certain musically-discerning member of the team is 
      firmly convinced that no jury in the world, outside the Andes, would every 
      convict anyone for shoving some pest's pipes up that pest's 
  pipe.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><!-- text below generated by server. PLEASE REMOVE --></OBJECT></LAYER>
