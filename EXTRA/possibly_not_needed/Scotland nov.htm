      Well, we headed to the Rio Alseseca in the state of Veracruz. A short run 
      of about only 5 km, but all good stuff. Drop-and-pool in character, mostly 
      boat-scoutable, and fairly much all good-to-go, with the exception of one 
      drop that didn't have enough water on the day we were there. It was

      <P class=style3>The next day and 600 km further down the road we decided 
      to visit some more ruined civilizations. There seems to be a bit of a 
      pattern developing here - we visit your town, civilization is ruined by a 
      mysterious disaster, we leave - but enough about the odour from our 
      sandals.</P>
      <P class=style3>We spent the morning at El Tajin, the city of the Tolmec 
      people. At its peak, it co-existed with Teotihuacan, but presumably not 
      peacefully. These guys were also into their pyramids, but with a 
      difference from the last place - this is Pyramide de los Niches.</P>

      <P class=style3>It's called the pyramid of the niches because of the 
      niches. That's on the exam at the end of the year: 'Can you cite one major 
      differences between the Teotihuacan and Tolmec building styles?' 
      Apparently there are 365 niches. Spooky, eh? The gods that the Tolmecs 
      worshipped were as blood-thirsty as before, but in this case they 
      sacrificed some of their own people, specifically, the guy who lost at 
      their ball game - El Tajin has 17 ball courts and the stone carvings 
      depict the loser of the game getting knived in the heart. And you thought 
      KP played a tough game of football in Herbert Park...</P>

      of them chants and plays the drums, the other four lob themselves off the

      before the place was even poroperly opened and headed. The Teotihuacan

      corrupt cops and have a bribe extorted for this?</P>
      <P class=style3>For bonus marks, try this extra question: </P>
      <P class=style3>What is the probability that having being forced to spent 
      four hours in a shopping center until the end of Hoy No Circula, the same 
      car would be pulled over for the infringement of carrying �cargo� by 
      different corrupt cops and have another bribe extorted?</P>
      <P class=style3>We have no pictures of these events, in fact we are luck 
      to have retained our cameras, which were demanded at one point. All in all 
      we spent about five hours in Mexico Districto Federal and it cost us about 
      Euro400. Easily the worst day of the trip.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>

      <P class=style3>We had been warned that the big cities of Guadalajara and 
      Mexico were terrible for corrupt cops pulling tourists over and extorting 
      bribes. On the outskirts of Guadalajara we were pulled over by a corrupt 
      cop and had a bribe extorted. Apparently the U.S. practice of only showing 
      one registration plate isn�t allowed in Mexico and the scumbag cop did us 
      a favour, apparently, by not giving us a ticket. The worst aspect of this 
      encounter was the big, complicated handshake afterwards to seal the deal. 
      Definitely the closest I�ve ever come to refusing to shake hands with 
      anyone. A cop taking a bribe is a lowlife, and this one tries to pretend 
      otherwise, but he knows it.</P>
      <P class=style3>We bypassed the town of Tequila. Probably a good move.</P>

      <P class=style3>We spent the night in the (almost) lakeside town of 
      Chapala. I say almost, because the lakes in that area of central Mexico 
      are seriously depleted by the heavy water demands of Guadalajara and 
      Mexico cities. The jetty is at a remove from the water�s edge. Worse 
      again, the lake is overgrown with water hyacinths, flourishing in the 
      overfertilised environment. The town itself is fairly cool, and there 
      seemed to be some kind of fiesta wrapping up when we 
  arrived.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>

      <P class=style3>Finally, it had to happen. Car trouble. Car goes chug 
      chug, we stop, Ferg crawls under it, removes a grimy pot-shaped part, and 
      replaces it with a shiny pot-shaped part. Car works fine again.</P>

      <P class=style3>Instead of repeating this news item on a weekly basis, 
      let�s just say that the problem is recurring and, slowly but surely, we

      At the moment, when the car goes chug chug, we stop for tortas and coffee 
      and let it cool down for a while. </P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
