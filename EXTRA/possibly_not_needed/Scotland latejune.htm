      class=style3>*********************************************************************************************</P>
      <P class=style3>Cuidad del Este is Paraguay's second city and exists 
      largely because of the building of the world's largest hydroelectric dam 
      and plant back in the 1970s. These days it's a duty free town popular with 
      Brasilians and Argentines who make the short trek across the Friendship 
      Bridge for the bargains. It's a messy but friendy town, despite its 
      unsavoury reputation; again not many tourists - mostly day trippers. Kind 
      of like Limerick really.</P>
      <P class=style3>This is the view from the park looking across the Rio 
      Parana to the Brasilian city of Foz de Iguazu. About five km south along 
      the river is the confluence with the Rio Iguazu. The confluence marks the 
      meeting point of Paraguay, Brasil, and Argentina.</P>
      <P class=style3><SPAN class=style31><IMG 
      src="Scotland latejune_files/cuidadandfoz.jpg"> </SPAN></P>
      <P class=style3>The following day, we took the Guatamala-style bus to the 
      Itaipu Dam, just north of the town.</P>
      <P class=style3><SPAN class=style31><IMG 
      src="Scotland latejune_files/itapubus.jpg"> </SPAN></P>
      <P class=style3>Until the Three Gorges Dam in China comes on line, this is 
      the biggest puppy - one of the wonders of the modern world. The dam (on 
      the right) is eight km long, the spillway (on the left) is only for 
      overflow. A joint project by Brasil (seen on the far side) and Paraguay 
      (foreground), it generates 25% of Brazil's electricity supply and 80% of 
      that of Paraguay. In terms of power ratings and size, this thing is 
      classified as really, really big.</P>
      <P class=style3><SPAN class=style31><IMG 
      src="Scotland latejune_files/itapudam.jpg"> </SPAN></P>
      <P class=style3>OK - here's the geography lesson again: In the foreground 
      you have Paraguay, the city on the left is Foz de Iguazu in Brasil, and 
      the city on the right is Puerto Iguazu, Argentina.</P>

      <P class=style3>Here's a blurry picture of the turbine room (sorry Simon, 
      it was dark). There are 18 of them, with two more being built, one on each 
      side. Amazingly, Brasil and Paraguay are on different voltages, but it all 
      seems to work fine.</P>

      <P class=style3>The next day, all overwhelmed with the immense achievement 
      of Itaipu, the team walks across the Friendship Bridge into Brasil. 
      Contrary to what everyone thought, spoken Portugese is nothing like spoken 
      Spanish. This was the first cultural shock of the new country.</P>
      <P class=style3>On the left, shoppers pour into duty free Cuidad del Este. 
      The motorbikes are taxis that zip over and back all day. We were the only 
      ones bothering with border formalities. A chaotic border crossing.</P>
      <P class=style3><SPAN class=style31><IMG 
      src="Scotland latejune_files/friendshipsbridge1.jpg"> </SPAN></P>
      <P class=style3>On our first night in Cuidad del Este we had strolled 
      across the bridge observing the smugglers at work. We don't know what was 
      in the packages, but a van was carrying them quarter way out from the 
      Paraguayan side, where they were transfered to motorbikes. The motorbikes 
      took them to within 200 metres of the Brasilian border control, where they 
      were thrown over the side of the bridge to some people waiting below. We 
      didn't stop to ask any questions.</P>

      <P class=style3>From Resistencia it was a short hop into Paraguay, one of 
      the real unknown countries on the itinerary. The border crossing was a 
      little tense as the team had conflicting information on whether Irish 
      citizens needed a visa or not. If they did, we would have to backtrack 300 
      km. As it turns out, that rule has been changed and everything went 
      smoothly, without special visas.</P>
      <P class=style3>Asuncion, the capital, was nothing like the book and other 
      gringos had lead us to believe. It was cool, very laid back, not at all as 
      impoverished as expected. We got the impression that not too many tourists 
      make their way there - once again Scotland '04+1 was a tourist 
      attraction.</P>

      <P class=style3>Don't get me wrong about the poverty - Paraguay is the 
      same as everywhere else in that there is a wide gap between rich and poor. 
      This is the shantytown, unusually though, it is located 10 metres from the 
      main plaza.</P>

      Mercedes Benz and alpelstrudel.</P>

      <P class=style3>The mountain was one of the richest deposits of silver in 
      the world and the Spanish conquistadores wasted no time in exploiting it 
      to the full. It didn't do the local Inca any good of course as all the 
      silver was sent directly to Madrid. This mountain financed the Spanish 
      Empire and all that went with it; Bolivia continues to be one of the 
      poorest nations on the planet.</P>
      <P class=style3>The Bolivians never lost their sense of humour, despite it 
      all. This is the entrance to the Casa de Moneda, the mint in which the 
      silver from the mountain was turned into Spanish coin. The mask over the 
      arch is a representation of the Roman god Bacchus, the god of wine and 
      good times. The liberated Bolivians put his laughing countenance up there 
      when the Spanish were being kicked out of their colony.</P>

      <P class=style3>This is the room, kept in darkness, where the minting was 
      carried out. The grinding and milling machines are made of durable cedar 
      wood, sent from Sapin by ship to Buenos Aires and then 14 months by mule 
      train to Potosi. It is estimated that this room generated over half of the 
      wealth of the Spanish Empire.</P>

      <P class=style3>This is an assay furnace in the metallurgical laboratory, 
      where the Spanish tested the quality and composition of the silver. This 
      photo is by request of Catherine for her brother Tim, who is crazy into 
      metallurgical stuff.</P>

      <P class=style3>It would be remiss of us to visit Bolivia and fail to put

      every country of South America.</P>

      The team stuck its collective head around the open door of a closed 
      theatre to have a look and the two children running the place offered them 
      the guided tour. This unofficial tour brings you up onto the roof, far 
      above the street. Thanks kids.</P>
